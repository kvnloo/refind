# refind
This is my refind config!
Visit https://goo.gl/cycMFC for more information!
BackgroundScript.sh may not be functioning correctly so do not use it unless you have verified it. The purpose of the script is to customize the background of your bootloader's wallpaper. My configuration makes use of rEFInd-minimal (visit https://goo.gl/7XnI9U to see the original repository), a clean theme for this bootmanager. Inside rEFInd-minimal you can find a set of white and black icons depending upon the background image. For convenience, I have placed two folders inside bg to split the images between dark and light. The BackgroundScript.sh will assign the according icon pack with the background depending on which directory it is in.

Feel free to reach out if you have any issues!
